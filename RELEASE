- Fixed bug in calculating index in DHoughFind(points) from
  original incarnation of this. Not sure if that caused problems
  before
- Added MakeIntoRootHist method to easily generate a ROOT
  TH2D from a DHoughFind object for debugging
- Added new "Add" method to add 2 DHoughFind objects together

In seTime method of DPhoton, added code to also set the t0 and t0_err fields of the underlying DKinematicData object. The DPhoton "time" still represents when the particle hit the detector. The t0 represents the time of the photon projected back to the vertex position as determined by the PHOTON_VERTEX_X, ... configuration parameters that by default are set to be at the center of the target (0,0,65). For now, the t0_err is fixed at 2ns, though that will likely need to be changed.

First "working" iteration of DPhysicsEvent. Only tested with a few p omega events with no background, but it at least runs and looks to be grouping particles together in a not too crazy way.

Return 0 for the fom if the dEdx list does not have any entries -- this probably means that the track parameters are completely inconsistent with the list of hits that went into the fit.  This eliminates a few cases where the fom was NaN.

Move the call to the stl vector erase in one part of the code to a later part of the sequence of code.  This was to address an occasional failure mode that caused candidates to be matched incorrectly.  Clean up computation of the momentum in GetPositionAndMomentum by removing several repeated operations.

Explicitly include start time in calculation of drift distance.  Define MAX_CHI2, currently set to 1e8, and bail from the fitting the chi2 exceeds this value. Use cbrt instead of pow(x,1./3.).
