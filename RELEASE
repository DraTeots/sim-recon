ET option is currently a copy of the File option and no ET code
is used yet. However, the structure now exists that will allow it
to be easily added.

A new utility to get info on the volume located at a
specific location in lab coordinates. This uses the
ROOT TGeo facility. The hddsroot.h file generated by
HDDS is compiled in and used by default. An option
exists to regenerate this file and compile and link 
it dynamically similar to what is now done in hdgeant.

Write initializer list for children in reverse order in generated HDDM 
constructor because that is the what is done in the class defnition. 
This prevents a compiler warning about items being initialized after 
other items.

This warning appeared after the geometry tag was introduced to event.xml. 
Prior to that, only one top-level tag existed (physicsEvent) so the 
ordering was unimportant.

Backing out previous change that reversed order that initializers
are emitted and instead reveresed order that tags are emitted at
end of HDDM class definition. The former's changed effected a lot
of other generated routines causing lots more warnings.

Changed paths:

OK, I think I finally got this. Reverted back most of the 
changes of the previous two commits and re-edited to split
the initializer list emission into 2 parts. The first only
emits the *_plist initializers since they always appear in
in the class definition first. The second emits the other
initializers. It turns out the ordering was already correct
as far as the tag names themselves, just the _plist vs. _link
ordering was not right.

One other minor modification was made to group some boolean
operations in an if() statement in 2 places where an
ambiguity was present. This was in response to a suggestion
by the clang compiler.

Added RF bunch selection to the PID determination.  Assumes high-luminosity running (i.e. too many tagger photons to distinguish the RF bunch).

How RF bunch selection works for an event (creating a DEventRFBunch object):
1) The measured RF time and variance are assumed to be zero (until actual measured values are introduced).
2) In DEventRFBunch_factory: loop over DTrackTimeBased objects, determine the matching start counter hits, propagate the start counter times to the target center and compare them to the RF time.
Note: tracks with bad vertex-z are ignored, and tracks with low track-reconstruction FOM are ignored unless there's no good tracks. 
Note: if there are no start counter hits then the track times from time-based tracking is used,
3) Vote: select the RF bunch that matches the most start counter hits (ties broken by tracking FOM).

How DChargedTrackHypothesis PID FOM calculation works:
1) If a track hypothesis has a start counter hit, select the RF bunch that best matches it (propagate start counter time to target center) (different hypotheses can match to different RF bunches)
Note: doing 1) allows the correct PID to be determined for background tracks originating from nearby beam buckets. 
2) If it does NOT have a start counter hit, then the DEventRFBunch time is used.
3) Compare the TOF/BCAL/etc. time to the RF time to calculate FOM.  

How DNeutralParticleHypothesis PID FOM calculation works:
1) Propagate shower times to the target center, compare them to the DEventRFBunch time.

Now uses the track time from time-based tracking to calculate PID FOM if a detector hit is missing. 
Now DEventRFBunch no longer uses the time-based tracking time from low-tracking-FOM tracks to select the RF bunch. 
Also, if the RF bunch cannot be determined (e.g. all bad tracks and no start counter hits), no DEventRFBunch objects are created.

Also, default BeamPhoton-RFtime cut now expanded to +/- 5 beam buckets (you could have bad tracks or no start counter hits mess up the bucket by a bunch or two).

Get FCAL geometry from XML.  Remove timing cut because the calculation assumed particles moving at the speed of light from the center of the target, thereby dropping clusters arising from slow-moving charged particles (with the default window (cut) setting of 5 ns).  I think this is the wrong place to apply this cut, especially if there are legitimate tracks that could be matched to these clusters.

Will not match to BCAL hits for tracks slower than 250 MeV/c (time resolution + PID error too high to pick RF bunch).
