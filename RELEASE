* calibDB.cc [rtj]
  - fixed formatting and comment spelling, no functional change
* hitTag.cc [rtj]
  - added fixed array hits in addition to microscope, requires a coordinated
    update to the hddm data model in libraries/HDDM
  - fetch counter energy bins from ccdb instead of the crude equal-size bins
    that existed prior to this update
  - limit the tagger hits to a +/- 20ns window around the trigger t=0 time,
    otherwise when BGGATE is enabled you will get hundreds of tagger hits
    which will never be used because they are too far out of time from the
    event trigger. This window is set by TAG_T_MIN_NS and TAG_T_MAX_NS in 
    the source code, and should be adjusted by changing these constants.

Added emulation of Df125PulseTime objects from the Df125WindowRawData
objects. For the moment, this uses a much simpler algorithm than what
will be put into the FPGA. It sets up the framework though and allows
the drift times to be seen in hdview2.

The conversion from drift time to distance is done in the DCDCTrackHit_factory.
Previously, this always set the "dist" value to be -1. It was to be
filled in later by the track fitter since only then would a time of flight
be known. The calculation copies the code from the DTrackFitterKalmanSIMD
class and assumes tof to wire is zero and B-field is 2T. These values
are currently hardwired and the second shoul be changed to at least use
an average field based on ring.

A shift of 170ns in the time is also hardwired for the moment in the
emulation routine for the Df125PulseTime. This is empirical from the
first 147 events of the original BCAL/CDC cosmic run data.

Improved algorithm for matching track candidates in the FDC for the case where at least one track candidate has hits in adjacent packages.  For example,  suppose one track candidate has hits in packages 1 and 2, a second has hits in packages in 3 and 4; in many cases these are not two separate tracks and should be linked together.  Added new routine for getting the position and momentum, needed for this improved matching method.

In the forward trajectory code, make sure the num_hits variable is initialized to avoid valgrind error.  Also explicitly handle the transition through the cdc endplate.

Added functionality to the BCAL Geometry.  The cell ID can be obtained from r,phi coordinates.

A global sector is introduced which goes from 1 (Mod 1, Sector1) through 192 (Mod 48, Sector 4).
Functions to convert to and from global sector are provided.

The additional functionalities are necessary for the calibration using track projections.

Improved method linking tracks with two segments each in the FDC together.  Improve method for linking stray FDC segments with already existing track candidates.  Add new method for linking forward-going CDC candidates with FDC candidates that attempts to use the outermost stereo straw to improve the circle fit for the CDC candidate by assuming that the actual hit occurs near the end of the straw, which would make sense if the track does indeed pass through the cdc endplate and produce hits in the first FDC package.

This plugin uses cosmic ray data for the BCAL and CDC together in 
order to calibrate the BCAL cells.  Projecting the DTrackCandidate
CDCCOSMIC line fitted to the CDC data allows a calibration of the 
BCAL cells based on the distance of travel of the cosmic through

Replace detid=2 with detid=20 for CAEN TDC modules. The various detector DAQs have broken the original scheme of using detid=1 for digitizing JLab modules and 2 for CAEN TDCs. detid=20 seems to be wht's in use by the TOF guys at the moment for CAEN1290s so we'll go with that.

Copy pedestal from PulsePedestal objects into PulseIntegral objects for both f250 and f125. The emulation and module-produced pedestals are not currently consistent. The emulated pedestal is scaled up by the ratio of Nped samples to Nwindow samples. The module produced pedestal is an average of Nped samples. Also, added a few more object associations that were missing for f125 and f250.

Extensive changes to better emulate how the f250 firmware converts waveforms 
into integrals.  Changes to handle different number of samples in the integration.

1) Introduce parameters that firmware uses for threshold and number of samples.  When analyzing data
   these parameters should be set to the same values as used inthe the firmware to correctly do
   pedestal subtraction.
        F250_THRESHOLD 
        F250_NSA 
        F250_NSB 
        F250_NSPED
2) Changed logic to use same criteria for sparsification as firmware.
3) Same definition of integration window as firmware.
4) Implemented the same constant fraction time algorithm.
5) Provide number of samples to derived F250 PI objects, both emulated and directly from firmware.

Disable use of new JANA features for modifying the call stack since they don't currently exist in any tagged version of JANA. The relevant lines have just been commented out using '//*'. These lines should be uncommented to get the proper behavior once JAN 0.7.2 is tagged and in use.

Changed paths:
   M /trunk/sim-recon/src/programs/Utilities/hddm/hddm-cpp.cpp

* hddm-cpp.cpp [rtj]
   - Added support for data integrity checks. When enabled on output,
     a 4-byte CRC is computed for the byte string of each event record
     and written to the file at the end of the record. When this file is
     read back, the CRC is computed for the event record read from the
     file and compared with the recorded CRC, throwing an exception if
     the two do not agree.
   - Fixed a problem reported by Matt Shepherd with reading hddm files on
     an updated version of MAC-OSX. David tracked this down to the behavior
     of stringstream::pubsetbuf whose intended use was to allow me to set
     the address of the internal buffer used by the stringstream to my own
     char array for access to the serialized stream. It works as intended
     on the libstdc++ distributed with Centos 6, but apparently it is a no-op
     in the stl library on the latest MAC-OSX. According to the standard
     template library documentation, the behavior of pubsetbuf is
     "implementation dependent", so stl developers are free to change it.
     Given that, I replaced the stringstream objects that I was using to
     work with the xstream library's XDR standard encoding classes and
     wrote my own streambuf classes based only on standard std::streambuf
     behaviors. There are no more pubsetbuf's in hddm code, so this
     should not happen again.

   - Modified the source path and library path for the hdds package
     to use the new-style $BMS_OSNAME/src and $BMS_OSNAME/lib paths
     instead of the older src and lib/$BMS_OSNAME paths.
   - Move the Add_xstream out of the AddJana method and into AddHDDM
     where it belongs; xstream is not directly used by jana classes
     but only through the HDDM classes they invoke, and other programs
     like genr8_2_hddm need xstream support for the c++ API to HDDM,
     but are not jana applications.

* DEventSourceHDDMGenerator.cc, DEventSourceRESTGenerator.cc [rtj]
   -Removed the code in CheckOpenable() that reads the header from the input
    file to check what kind of hddm stream it is, whether a pure mcgen file,
    a simulated hits file, a rest file, or whatever. That code worked for
    regular files, but if the input stream is a pipe then the CheckOpenable()
    method would eat the file header, and leave the stream without a header
    when a DEventSource constructor comes along later to open it for reading.
    If we want to accomodate reading from pipes, the best we can do is to
    guess which variety of input hddm stream it is based on the filename.
    That is what the revised versions of these CheckOpenable() methods do.

   - Switch from using stringstreams to buffer hddm records because of
     non-standard behavior of pubsetbuf method. Replace with my own
     subclasses of std::streambuf and rely only on standard methods.
   - Modified to support hddm streams with a CRC32 integrity check appended
     to each event record, computed and written upon output and recomputed
     and automatically verified against the saved value upon input. This
     feature is off by default, but can be enabled by the setIntegrityChecks()
     method of hddm_X::ostream any time the ostream object is open.

   -Replace direct access to stdio streams (with xdrstdio_create) with
    in-memory formatting (with xdrmem_create) of serialized event records
    coupled with fread/fwrite access to the stdio streams. This duplicates
    in the c API the way that records are handled in the c++ API, and it
    allows hddm i/o to work directly over network sockets, without using
    intermediate files.

Make entries into the ParticleType_t enum to allow
types 80,81,82 (sort of). These particle ids are used
by bggen (see pythia-geant.map). However, the values
80, 81 corresponding to the Rh0 and Omega respectively
are conflicting with existing enum entries for those
particles. The value 82 corresponds to the Delta++ for
which there was no entry. This commit adds an entry for
the Delta++ and introduces a RemapParticleID function
to quietly remap the other two to the existing numbers
in the subroutines that use them.

* PID/DEventRFBunch_factory.cc [rtj]
   - The DEventRFBunch_factory::evnt() method was assuming that there would
     always be a DBeamPhoton object with tag MCGEN for every event. This is 
     generally true for simulated events, but evio files contain no such
     object and this would produce a segfault. This fix exits gracefully
     without making any DEventRFBunch objects if the DBeamPhoton object 
     with tag MCGEN is not found.
* ANALYSIS/DEventRFBunch_factory_Combo.cc, 
  PID/DChargedTrackHypothesis_factory.cc,
  PID/DNeutralParticleHypothesis_factory.cc [rtj]
   - These factories would also segfault if no DEeventRFBunch objects is
     found in an event, cascading from the issue identified above. This
     fix exits gracefully from methods that look for DEventRFBunch
     objects if none exist for this event.

* FCAL/DFCALCluster.h, DFCALCluster.cc [rtj]
   - The DFCALCluster::saveHits routine was falsely generating warnings
     about corrupted clusters whenever the input source was an evio file
     or (presumably) the ET. This was because it was going through the
     list of hits in a cluster and checking their ID values are valid.
     However the way this check was being performed was buggy because it
     was based on the assumption that the hit ID values were of type
     signed int, and should be non-negative. However the actual ID values
     being stored in the hit struct are of type JObject::oid_t which is
     unsigned int. Browsing elsewhere in the JANA library code I see that
     oid_t values may cover the full unsigned int range, except that NULL
     (0) is considered invalid (not an identifier of any object). Hence
     I made the following changes to DFCALCluster:
         1) make the return type from getHitID() be JObject::oid_t 
            instead of int;
         2) make the check for corruption in saveHits() look for 0
            unsigned int values rather than negative int.

* DFCALCluster_factory.cc [rtj]
   - Whadayaknow, it seems that jana DOES assign the NULL value as a valid
     oid_t value for JObjects. So what are we supposed to return for oid_t
     value to indicate "no such JObject"? Not -1, because oid_t is unsigned.
     Maybe a special code with a name like JObject::NoSuchObject? Unable to
     figure this out, I punt by adding 1 to the JObject::id value before I
     use it, and then I can use != 0 as my test for validity. This will 
     fail if jana generates an object with id == 0xffffffff.
