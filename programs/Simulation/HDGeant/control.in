C This is the control file for the GEANT simulation.  Parameters defined
C in this file control the kind and extent of simulation that is performed.
C The full list of options is given in section BASE-40 of the GEANT manual.
C
C In addition, some new cards have been defined to set up the input source
C for the simulation.  Three kinds of simulation runs are available, selected
C by which of the following three "cards" are present below.
C    1. Input from Monte Carlo generator (card INFILE)
C    2. Built-in coherent bremsstrahlung source (card BEAM)
C    3. Built-in single-track event generator (card KINE)
C The order of the list is significant, that is if INFILE is present then the
C BEAM and KINE cards are ignored, otherwise if BEAM is present then KINE is
C ignored.  For example, the 3-card sequence:
C     INFILE 'phi-1680.hddm'
C     SKIP 25
C     TRIG 100
C instructs HDGeant to open ./phi-1680.hddm, skip the first 25 events and then
C process the following 100 input events and stop.  If the end of the file is
C reached before the event count specified in card TRIG is exhausted then the
C processing will stop at the end of file.

TRIG 1000
cINFILE 'rhop.hddm'
BEAM 12. 9.
RUNG 9999

c Commenting out the following line will disable simulated hits output.
OUTFILE 'hdgeant.hddm'

c The following card enables single-track generation (for testing).
c For a single-particle gun, set the momentum (GeV/c), direction
c theta,phi (degrees) and vertex position (cm), and for the particle
c type insert the Geant particle type code plus 100 (eg. 101=gamma,
c 103=electron, 107=pi0, 108=pi+, 109=pi-, 114=proton).  If you use
c the particle code but do not add 100 then theta,phi are ignored
c and the particle direction is generated randomly over 4pi sr.
c For a listing of the Geant particle types, see the following URL.
c http://wwwasdoc.web.cern.ch/wwwasdoc/geant_html3/node72.html
c   particle  momentum  theta  phi  vertex(x y z)
KINE   109      1.5        0.   0.    0. 0. 65.

c The following lines control the rate (GHz) of background beam photons
c that are overlayed on each event in the simulation, in addition to the
c particles produced by the standard generation mechanism.  A value of
c 1.25 corresponds to nominal GlueX running conditions at an intensity of
c 10^7 tagged photons on target per second.  To disable the generation of
c random beam background, comment this line out or set the value of BGRATE
c to zero.  Background beam photons are generated during the time interval
c given by the BGGATE card, whose two arguments specify the earliest and
c latest times (ns relative to the time of the original photon that caused
c the event) that a random beam photon could produce background hits
c somewhere in the detector.  Note that for this to work, the BEAM card
c must be present (see above).  This means that background generation is
c disabled when the simulation operates in particle gun mode.
BGRATE 1.25
BGGATE -200. 200.

C The following card seeds the random number generator so it must be unique
C for each run.  There are two ways to specify the random see for a run.
C  1. One argument, must be an integer in the range [1,215]
C  2. Two arguments, must be a pair of positive Integer*4 numbers
C In the first case, one of a limited set of prepared starting seeds is
C chosen from a list.  These seeds have been certified to produce random
C sequences that do not repeat within the first 10^9 or so random numbers.
C For cases where more choices are needed, the two-argument form gives
C access to a total of 2^62 choices, with no guarantees about closed loops.

c The following line controls a set of generic flags that are used to
c control aspects of the simulation generally related to debugging.
c For normal debugging runs these should be left at zero (or omitted).
c At present the following functionality is defined (assumes debug on).
c  SWIT(2) = 0 turns off trajectory tracing
c          = 2 turns on step-by-step trace during tracking (verbose!)
c          = 3 turns on trajectory plotting after tracking is done
c          = 4 turns on step-by-step plotting during tracking
c  SWIT(3) = 1 stores track trajectories for plotting after tracking is done
c  SWIT(4) = 0 trace trajectories of all particle types
c          = 3 trace only charged particle trajectories

C The following card selects the hadronic physics package
C   HADR 0	no hadronic interactions
C   HADR 1	GHEISHA only (default)
C   HADR 2	GHEISHA only, with no generation of secondaries
C   HADR 3      FLUKA (with GHEISHA for neutrons below 20MeV)
C   HADR 4	FLUKA (with MICAP for neutrons below 20MeV)

c The following cards are needed if optical photons are being
c being generated and tracked in the simulation.  The CKOV directive
c enables Cerenkov generation in materials for which the refractive
c index table has been specified.  The LABS card enables absorption
c of optical photons.  The ABAN directive controls a special feature
c of Geant which allows it to "abandon" tracking of charged particles
c once their remaining range drops below the distance to the next
c discrete interaction or geometric boundary.  Particles abandoned
c during tracking are stopped immediately and dump all remaining energy
c where they lie.  The remaining energy is dumped in the correct volume
c so this is OK in most cases, but it can cut into the yield of
c Cerenkov photons (eg. in a lead glass calorimeter) at the end of
c a particle track.  If this might be important, set ABAN to 0.
CKOV 1
LABS 1

C The following card prevents GEANT tracking code from abandoning the
C tracking of particles near the end of their range, once it determines
C that their fate is just to stop (i.e. electrons and protons).  This
C behaviour is normal in most cases, but in the case of Cerenkov light
C generation it leads to an underestimate for the yields.
C   ABAN 1	abandon stopping tracks (default)
C   ABAN 0	do not abandon stopping tracks
ABAN 0

c The following card sets up the simulation to perform debugging on
c a subset of the simulated events.
c DEBUG first last step
c  - first (int) = event number of first event to debug
c  - last (int) = event number of last event to debug
c  - step (int) = only debug one event every step events
DEBUG 0 0 1

c The following card can be used to turn off generation of secondary
c particles in the simulation, ordinarily it should be 0 (or omitted).
NOSECONDARIES 0

c The following card tells the simulation to store particle trajectories
c in the output file.  This output can be verbose, use with caution.
