C This is the control file for the GEANT simulation.  Parameters defined
C in this file control the kind and extent of simulation that is performed.
C The full list of options is given in section BASE-40 of the GEANT manual.
C
C In addition, some new cards have been defined to set up the input source
C for the simulation.  Three kinds of simulation runs are available, selected
C by which of the following three "cards" are present below.
C    1. Input from Monte Carlo generator (card INFILE)
C    2. Built-in coherent bremsstrahlung source (card BEAM)
C    3. Built-in single-track event generator (card KINE)
C The order of the list is significant, that is if INFILE is present then the
C BEAM and KINE cards are ignored, otherwise if BEAM is present then KINE is
C ignored.  For example, the 3-card sequence:
C     INFILE 'phi-1680.hddm'
C     SKIP 25
C     TRIG 100
C instructs HDGeant to open ./phi-1680.hddm, skip the first 25 events and then
C process the following 100 input events and stop.  If the end of the file is
C reached before the event count specified in card TRIG is exhausted then the
C processing will stop at the end of file.

TRIG 10
INFILE 'rhop.hddm'
cBEAM 12. 9.
RUNG 9999

C The following card enables single-track generation (for testing)
C    particle  energy  theta  phi  vertex(x y z)
KINE   108       1.0     30.  45.    0. 0. 65.

C The following card seeds the random number generator so it must be unique
C for each run.  There are two ways to specify the random see for a run.
C  1. One argument, must be an integer in the range [1,215]
C  2. Two arguments, must be a pair of positive Integer*4 numbers
C In the first case, one of a limited set of prepared starting seeds is
C chosen from a list.  These seeds have been certified to produce random
C sequences that do not repeat within the first 10^9 or so random numbers.
C For cases where more choices are needed, the two-argument form gives
C access to a total of 2^62 choices, with no guarantees about closed loops.
