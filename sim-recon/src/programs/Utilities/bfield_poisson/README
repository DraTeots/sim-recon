The files in this directory were semi-large and of
specialized use (calculating 2-D B-field map for
GlueX Solenoid). Because of this, they were moved
out of here into my private area of the repository.
This is just a place where they are not going to
be checked out with every sim-recon distribution,
but still accessible for anyone who wants them.
To check them out, issue the following:

svn co https://halldsvn.jlab.org/repos/trunk/home/davidl/bfield_poisson
