The hddm2root program provides a general system for converting
HDDM formatted files to ROOT format. The conversion is non-trivial
and therefore is implemented in 2 stages.

The first stage is running the hddm2root program itself, giving
either and HDDM file or XML file as input. (The HDDM file will
contain a copy of the XML file at the beginning.) This will
generate several C++ source code files that can be used to
produce a custom tool for the HDDM class used to generate the
file you wish to convert. The files are placed in a directory
named hddm_root_generated along with a makefile for building
the tool. The user is asked to run "make" and then access the
tool from the hddm_root_generated directory.

The second stage runs this tool on the HDDM file to produce
a ROOT file.

Certain limitations exist with this method. See the usage
statement of the hddm2root program for details. (Run it with
no arguments for a usage statement.)
