README  DAQ plugin

Nov. 27, 2012  David Lawrence

This directory contains files for the DAQ plugin which is used
to read in EVIO formatted data obtained from the Hall-D data
acquisition system. The plugin will read in from either an ET
system or an EVIO formatted file, parsing the input and creating
low-level hit objects.

At this time, the Hall-D DAQ system does not yet exist, but a 
library, mc2coda, does that can convert Simulated data into
the EVIO format we expect the DAQ system to deliver.

The structure of the code has the bulk of the difficult work
being done in the JEventSource_EVIO class. The JEventSource_FileEVIO
and JEventSource_ETEVIO classes derive from this, but only
to instantiate different subclasses of evioChannel. The ET system
may require creation of a station. In addition there is talk
of packaging multiple EVIO events into a single ET buffer which
might require additional handling.
