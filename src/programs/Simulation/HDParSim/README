This directory contains files that can be used to include GEANT-derived
tracking resolutions and efficiencies in parametric simulations
of the GlueX detector.

The values are kept as histograms in the ROOT file hd_res_charged.root
which must be present in whatever directory the program is run in.

The ROOT Macro PlotRes.C is included to make a set of plots from the
histograms in the ROOT file.

The macro MargeResFiles.C can be used to splice together 2 different
hd_res_charged.root files taking the lower theta range from 1 and the
upper theta range from the other. This is useful for combining the
results from 2 different simulation runs.
